Here are dotfiles for my systems, Framework 13 (AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 & 2.8k display) and M1 MacBook Air.
MBA runs the latest version of macOS, and Framework runs the latest version of Fedora Workstation (I also run Sway alongside of Gnome, check [Haunted Tiles](https://github.com/theopn/haunted-tiles/) out for my Sway config).

Tools in this repository are mostly open-source utilities for development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Read the code if you decide to use them!**

## Utilities

### Shells

- Bash: Basic configuration for my school SSH server
- ZSH: My `$SHELL`
    - Minimal plugin manager (`plug`, `plug_update`) to download and source [zsh-autocompletion](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete)
    - Rudimentary implementation of trash-cli (`trash`)
    - Git info in the prompt
- **Fish**: Main interactive shell
    - Fish writes universal variables to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish/fish_variables` for better performance.
        Thus, you need to set global variables only once for your system.
        I created a script to set all the universal environment variables at once; run: `fish $HOME/dotfiles/fish/.config/fish/set-universal.fish`
    - multicd: `..` to `cd ..`, `...` to `cd../..`, ...
    - CD favorites/bookmark: `cdf_add` to add current directory to the list, `cdf` to use FZF to search the directoy and CD into it, and `cdf_edit` to edit the list with `$EDITOR`

### Terminal emulators and multiplexers

- Tmux - things different from the defaults:
    - Settings: Some terminal information, all indexing starts from 1, increased history limit, and reduced escape time
    - `C-a` is the prefix, and `PFX + C-a` sends `C-a` to the terminal
    - `PFX + C-r` reloads the config
    - `PFX + c` creates a new window *with the same CWD as the current pane*
    - `PFX + %/"` creates a new pane *with the same CWD as the current pane*
    - `PFX + hjkl` navigates panes (the default `l` is unbound which is `:last-window`)
    - `PFX + C-s` prompts you to send the current pane to a selected window
    - Vi-copy-mode is set, `y` in copy mode yanks the selection -- I do not know what this is not the default since `y` is not bound to anything by default
    - Dracula themed status bar displaying the current session & window information, CWD, and current command running
    - Use `PFX + ?` (list keys) and `PFX + / + <key>` (describe key) for more help
- **Wezterm**: My favorite terminal emulator. Watch my YouTube video [Configure Wezterm terminal emulator in Lua with me [ASMR Coding]](https://youtu.be/I3ipo8NxsjY) :)
    - Many keybindings in the video now has been changed to match the Tmux keybindings, but the overall functionality remains the same
    - `LDR` = `C-a`
    - `LDR [`: enters the copy mode
    - `LDR :`: opens the command palette
    - `LDR s`: opens the fuzzy picker for workspace (similar to sessions in Tmux)
    - Tabs (similar to windows in Tmux)
        - `LDR w`: opens the picker for tabs
        - `LDR c`: creates a new tab
        - `LDR p/n`: navigates previous/next tabs
        - `LDR ,`: renames the tab
        - `LDR .`: enters the `move_tab` mode where you can use `hj`/`kl` to order tabs and `ESC` or `RET` to confirm
        - `LDR 1-9`: moves to the tab with the given index
    - Panes
        - `LDR %/"`: creates a new pane vertically/horizontally
        - `LDR hjkl`: navigates pane
        - `LDR SPC`: zooms the current pane
        - `LDR x`: closes the current pane
        - `LDR !`: breaks the current pane into a new tab
        - `LDR r`: enters the `resize_pane` mode where you can resize the pane with `<>-+` and `ESC` or `RET` to confirm
    - `$ wezterm show-keys --lua` to get the Lua table of all keybindings available
- Kitty: The secondary terminal
    - Colorscheme can be changed with `kitten themes`

### Text editors:

- **Neovim**: My IDE, to-do list, Pomodoro timer, and a life-long software engineering project. Read [`:h theovim`](./nvim/.config/nvim/doc/theovim.txt), a ~700~ 1000 lines of help documentation I wrote on custom functions, plugin configurations, and Vim tips I have accumulated over the years
    - Read [Neovim content](https://theopark.me/tags/neovim/) in my blog!
- Neovide: Neovim GUI frontend with pretty animations
- Vim: Simple config with Vimwiki for journal writing
    - My Vimrc is built with [Kickstart.vim](https://github.com/theopn/kickstart.vim), features 
    - `.vim/plugin` directory features [40-line Vimscript bufferline](https://theopark.me/blog/2023-03-17-vimscript-bufferline/) and ["Bufferpanel"](https://theopark.me/blog/2025-06-01-tabpanel/)
    - Choose between `(Bufferpanel + Tabline) || (Tabpanel + Bufferpanel)` by setting `g:theoline_buflist` and `g:theopanel:buflist` variables

### Others

- **LF**: Simple and fast terminal file manager
    - For my custom `preview` script support: install `bat` and Poppler (for `pdftotext` command);
        make sure your terminal has either (1) [Sixel](https://www.arewesixelyet.com/) support and has `chafa` installed OR (2) Kitty's `icat` protocol support
    - If preview breaks, which might happen while displaying images in Tmux, use `C-l` to reset the screen
    - `ee`: Open a file in `$EDITOR`
    - `ec`: You choose what editor you want to open a file in
    - `DD`: Move a file to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/theoshell/trash`
    - `gs`: [g]it [s]tatus
    - `ml`, `mr`, `ms`: [m]ark [l]oad, [m]ark [r]emove, [m]ark [s]ave
    - `md`: mkdir
    - `mf`: Create a file and open in `$EDITOR`
    - `mo`: chmod
- Git: Some Git settings and global `.gitignore` file; `editor` and `pager` are set to require Neovim
- Fastfetch: essential

## macOS

### macOS Tiling WM Setup

Tools used to create my Tokyo-Night-themed tiling WM setup for my macOS environment:

- [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace)
- [Sketchybar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar)

Install Aerospace and Sketchybar

```bash
brew install nikitabobko/tap/aerospace FelixKratz/formulae/sketchybar
```

Add Aerospace to your login item in System Settings.
Aerospace will automatically launch Sketchybar on the startup.
**Do not use `brew services start sketchybar` to launch Sketchybar** as Sketchybar needs to be launched after Aerospace has been launched (via `after-startup-command` in `aerospace.toml`) in order to correctly render workspaces.

The configuration and keybindings are very close to the default with a couple of tweaks (the `opt`/`alt`/`âŒ¥` key is the modifier):

- `alt-shift-space`: Toggle between floating and tiling for the current window
- `alt-enter`: Open Wezterm
- `alt-d`: Open Terminal with a command to pick a window to focus
    This feature is a workaround and should be updated when it is implemented natively, see: https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/1371
- `alt-slash`: Toggle between horizontal and vertical tiling
- `alt-comma`: Toggle between horizontal and vertical accordion mode
- `alt-h/j/k/l`: Focus windows
- `alt-shift-h/j/k/l`: Move windows
- `alt-minus/equal` (`-/+`): Resize window
- `alt-1 - 9`: Move to workspace 1 - 9
- `alt-shift-1 - 9`: Move the current tree to workspace 1 - 9
- `alt-tab`: Switch between previously used workspaces
- `alt-shift-tab`: Move current workspace to a different monitor
- `alt-shift-space`: Enter the service mode
    - `esc`: Reload the config and exit the service mode
    - `r`: Reset layout and exit the service mode
    - `alt-shift-h/j/k/l`: Join windows into different trees

> ![NOTE]
> In this [commit](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/commit/5aabca5b4d86afa55fb5f1c6cfa06f1e413448fd), a rudimentary UI customization for the Aerospace tray icon has been added, which is frankly all I need.
> Along with [Ice](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice), I am experimenting with the native menu bar.
